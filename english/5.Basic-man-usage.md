# Basic man usage

Man is one of the most important commands in Linux. You can use it to easily find information on other commands without needing an internet connection.

## Read about a command

Run man, with the name of the command after it :

```
$ man touch
```

> [!TIP]
> If man is not found on your system, try running ```# apt install man man-db```.

## Navigating a man page

Man pages open in a ```less```/```vim``` style layout. Move up and down with "k" and "j" and find specific info with "/". Quit by pressing "q" on your keyboard.

This command is a true life saver; especially if you are a student in an exam. This has helped me before.

## Task

Go to your home directory, read the man page for ```ls```, and show the hidden files.
