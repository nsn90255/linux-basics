# Basic users and permissions

Linux is a UNIX-like operating system. It was made for, and excels at multi user configurations; that is, having multiple users on the same computer (even at the same time!!).

## Users

You can see info on you user by running ```whoami``` in your terminal :

```
$ whoami
your_user_name
```

Users might be used by system processes to easily perform tasks. You can see the users on your computer by running the following command :

```
$ cat /etc/passwd
```

## Groups

Similarly, you can see you groups with ```groups``` :

```
$ groups
your_user_name users wheel seat
```

Groups are a way to easily enable (or restrict) permissions in a system. Users always have at least one group (usually one of the same name as them). To see all the groups in your system, run the following :

```
$ cat /etc/group
```

## Root

Root is a special user account present by default on most Linux systems. It is basically god. It can do anything you ask it to, as opposed to your regular user.

To use root, you can switch to it :

```
$ su -
```

Or you can use sudo :

```
$ sudo your_command
```

When I mean anything, I mean it. Remember the ```rm -rf``` command from before? Try to guess what happens when you run it on / as root. Yeah, you whipe your entire hard drive. Use root with caution.

# Task

Use root or ```sudo``` to create a file in /.
