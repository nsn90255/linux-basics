# Basic file handling

In Linux (almost) everything is a file. This makes customisation and configuration very easy, as you don't have to do weird things in the opaque registry (like in Windows).

## Creating a file

To create a regular text file, use the touch command :

```
$ touch myFile
```

Now, if we run ls, we see our empty file.

```
$ ls
myFile
```

## Editing a file

The file we just created is empty. Let's try to add something to it! We recommend ```nano``` for this because it's the easiest for new users. But you can also use ```vim```, ```emacs```...

```
nano myFile
```

You will be thrown into a nano window. Write anything you want : like "I love New York". Now save it with ctrl+o, press enter to confirm, and quit with ctrl+x.

## Reading a file

Let's read our new file using ```cat```.

```
$ cat myFile
I love New York
```

## File extensions

You might have noticed that we didn't use file extensions. We could have called our file ```myFile.txt``` or ```myFile.xd```. File extensions just provide extra information about the file; they form part of the name and don't do anything special.

# Task

Create a file in ```Documents/``` called ```presentation```, write something, and print it.
