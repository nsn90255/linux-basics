# Basic file system structure

In Linux files are stored in a specific way. There is no "C:\" drive; everything is unified. Here are the basics for now.

```
/ : root of the file system, everything else hangs from it.

/home/ : user homes. As a regular user, you files are in ```/home/your_user_name/```.

/etc/ : system configuration

/usr/bin/ : installed programs
```

We will learn more about the file system later on, but for now that's all you need to know.

## Your home

When you log in, your shell might look somthing like this :

```
your_user_name@system:~ $ 
```

That "~" means ```/home/your_user_name```. We can always access it by using ```cd ~/``` or just ```cd```.

## Relative vs absolute paths

Referencing files like that is called using relative paths, because they are relative to your user.

- Relative path: ```~/Downloads/4kvideo.mp4```

- Absolute path: ```/home/your_user_name/Downloads/4kvideo.mp4```

We have been using relative paths all throughout this lesson : remember ```myFile``` ? That was actually ```/home/your_user_name/myFile```. We only saw it like that because we were in the same directory as it.

Your current directory is always ".", and it's parent "..". You can see this if you try to run ```cd .```. It will do nothing. However, if you use ```cd ..``` you will go up one directory.

# Task

Move to ```~/Documents```, and create a file in ```~/``` called "hello.txt". There are multiple ways to do this.

    $ cd Documents

    Documents/ $ touch ../hello.txt

    You could also do it like this

    $ cd Documents

    Documents/ $ touch ~/hello.txt

    Or even like this

    $ cd Documents

    Documents/ $ touch /home/your_user_name/hello.txt
