# Advanced man usage

## Sections

Man pages are organised into sections (from man.1) :

```
       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7), man-pages(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]
```

Every man page is classified into one of these sections. But why ? Well, more than one tool can have the same name on a system.

For example, printf can either refer to the shell command, or the C standard library function :

- shell command --> printf.1

- C function --> printf.3

Additionally, you may have variants of these files for the POSIX conforming versions of these utilities :

- your system's coreutils' cat --> cat.1

- POSIX cat --> cat.1p


> [!NOTE]
> POSIX is a set of specifications on how a UNIX system should behave. UNIX-like systems like Linux distros and the BSDs try to follow it. MacOs is actually fully POSIX certified.

## Searching for pages

You can search for man pages by using the ```-k``` flag :

```
$ man -k myUtility
```

This will print out man pages and descriptions matching your string.

Similarly, you can also use the ```apropos``` or ```whatis``` commands to achieve the same result.

# Task

- Find out what the ```-i``` flag of the ```mv``` command does by reading its man page.
