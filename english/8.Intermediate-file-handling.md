# Intermediate file handling

Everything is a file in a unix system. The more comfortable you are with them, the better.

## Grep

To find info in a file, you can use the ```grep``` command. This will try to match the string "my info" from the file ```myFileWithInfo.txt```.

```
$ grep "my info" myFileWithInfo.txt
```

Except, we can use it for more... But we will see that later.


## Tail and Head

```tail``` and ```head``` are nice little commands that allow you to print the last and first lines of a file respectively.

### Tail

You can print the last 10 lines of a file by using ```tail```.

```
$ tail myFile.txt
```

Or the last x lines (3 lines in the below example).

```
$ tail -3 myFile.txt
```

### Head

Similarly, you can print the first 10 lines of a file with ```head```.

```
$ head myFile.txt
```

Or just the first x lines (1 line in the below example).

```
$ head -1 myFile.txt
```

# Task

- Print the last line of this file

- Print every line that contains the letter "e" in this file.
