# Intermediate file handling

Everything is a file in a unix system. The more comfortable you are with them, the better.

## Grep

To find info in a file, you can use the ```grep``` command. This will try to match the string "my info" from the file ```myFileWithInfo.txt```.

```
$ grep "my info" myFileWithInfo.txt
```

Except, we can use it for more...

### Grep and pipes

```grep``` is one of the most fun commands to pipe into. The command ```ps``` lists running processes on the system. The following example pipes the output of ```ps``` into ```grep``` to find all instaces of ```bash``` running. Ignore the ```ps``` flags, those are for pretty formatting.

```
$ ps -eo user,pid,%cpu,%mem,command --sort=-%cpu | grep bash
root          630  0.0  0.0 /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/check_battery_or_ac.sh
myuser       1620  0.0  0.1 /usr/bin/bash --posix
myuser      75569  0.0  0.1 /usr/bin/bash --posix
otheruser   64475  0.0  0.1 -bash
myuser      64323  0.0  0.1 /usr/bin/bash --posix
myuser      24461  0.0  0.1 /usr/bin/bash --posix
myuser     120523  0.0  0.0 grep --color=auto bash
```

## Tail and Head

```tail``` and ```head``` are nice little commands that allow you to print the last and first lines of a file respectively.

### Tail

You can print the last 10 lines of a file by using ```tail```.

```
$ tail myFile.txt
```

Or the last x lines (3 lines in the below example).

```
$ tail -3 myFile.txt
```

### Head

Similarly, you can print the first 10 lines of a file with ```head```.

```
$ head myFile.txt
```

Or just the first x lines (1 line in the below example).

```
$ head -1 myFile.txt
```

# Task

- Print the last line of this file

- Print every line that contains the letter "e" in this file.
